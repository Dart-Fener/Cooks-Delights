        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <blockquote>Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Most importantly, Allrecipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.</blockquote>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <blockquote>Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Allrecipes changed the food world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips, while celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then, Allrecipes has become the world's largest community-driven food brand, providing trusted resources to more than 60 million home cooks each month.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Every day, cooks from around the world publish recipes and inspire one another through recipe photos, ratings, reviews, and videos. The combination of the Allrecipes community with our team of editorial and kitchen professionals provides authority found nowhere else on the internet and has turned the brand into an indispensable resource for cooks of all skill levels.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>You can connect with us and our 11M followers on social media, too. On TikTok, learn how you should store avocados or find out if air fryer coconut shrimp lives up to the hype.

        <h2>Kitchen-Approved Recipes</h2>
        <blockquote>
            When Allrecipes’ readers add a recipe to the site, they may choose to save it as private, only share it on their profile page, or submit it for Kitchen Approved consideration. Recipes submitted to be Kitchen Approved are evaluated by our team of recipe editors, who ensure the originality and reliability of each recipe, and edit for Allrecipes style. Each recipe undergoes a series of reviews for:  
            <ul>
                <li><span>Duplication: </span>Editors verify that the recipe doesn't duplicate another that has already been published.</li>
                <li><span>Completion: </span>ingredient list is evaluated to be sure it is complete, that measurements are correct, and that ingredients are properly ordered and grouped according to their use.</li>
                <li><span>Accuracy: </span>Serving sizes and yields are checked for accuracy and to be sure that recipes reflect USDA dietary recommendations.</li>
                <li><span>Replication: </span>Recipes are reviewed and edited to ensure they are replicable when following the instructions. Editors assess the techniques, equipment, and appliances used in the recipes, and  explain any intermediate or advanced techniques with simple language and visuals.</li>
                <li><span>Health claims: </span>Editors evaluate the use of any health or nutrition claims — such as healthy, low-carb, low-fat, or paleo — based on guidelines from the dieticians at our sister brand, Eating Well.</li>
            </ul>
            Once recipes are evaluated and edited, they are not only reliable but also compatible with our nutrition analysis, scaling, shopping list, and other recipe tools. Only the best recipes achieve Kitchen Approved status and get published and promoted.After publication, the Allrecipes audience can add their own photos, ratings, and reviews to recipes. In the reviews, they share tips for making recipes even better and adjusting them to personal tastes or diets.

        <h2>Allrecipes Magazine Recipe Testing</h2>
        <blockquote>Recipes selected for publication in Allrecipes magazine get further scrutiny and testing.. Magazine recipes are tested one to four times in our test kitchens in Des Moines, Iowa, and Birmingham, Alabama.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Trained test kitchen professionals prepare every recipe and then taste and evaluate it with recipe and story editors, confirming and clarifying all key components (including ingredient types and amounts, cooking procedures and times and temperatures, yields), and incorporating changes as needed to improve flavor, ease, and visual appeal.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>For recipes that have a long trail of user commentary, editors and testers also evaluate and incorporate suggestions from the community. Fully tested and edited recipes are then prepared by a food stylist for professional photography and reviewed again by a registered dietitian for nutrition and health-related tags used in the magazine (Healthy Pick, Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free).</blockquote>
